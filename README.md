## üß© Problem Statement

In the modern digital world, laptops come with a wide variety of configurations and prices. Customers often get confused about whether the price they are paying is fair or not. Retailers and resellers also need accurate price predictions for inventory decisions and resale value estimation.

**Objective**:  
To build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications such as processor, RAM, storage type, screen size, etc.

## üß† Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handled categorical encoding  
   - Converted screen resolution and storage into usable numeric values  
   - Extracted brand-level details from CPU and GPU strings  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyzed price distribution across companies and configurations  
   - Visualized trends using plots for better understanding  

3. **Model Building**:  
   - Applied multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest  
   - Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning  

4. **Evaluation**:  
   - Metrics used: R¬≤ Score, MAE, RMSE

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- The model accurately predicts the price of a laptop with a high R¬≤ score on test data.
- Important features influencing laptop prices: **CPU brand**, **RAM**, **SSD size**, **GPU**, and **Screen Resolution**.
- This model can be used in e-commerce platforms for **automated pricing engines**, or in consumer tools for **price fairness checks**.
